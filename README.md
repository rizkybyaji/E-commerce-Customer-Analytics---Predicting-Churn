## 🧠 Background
In the highly competitive e-commerce industry, retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Key statistics:
- Customer acquisition can cost 5–25 times more than retention.
- Increasing customer retention by 5% can boost profits by 25%–95%.

Thus, predicting customer churn enables businesses to take preventive actions and improve retention strategies.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Identify customers at high risk of churn.
- Provide data-driven insights to support customer retention strategies.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes customer behavior information, transactions, and other relevant features for churn classification.

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Business Understanding**
2. **Data Understanding**
3. **Data Preparation & Cleaning**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Feature Engineering**
6. **Modeling**
   - Algorithms used: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, etc.
7. **Evaluation**
   - F1-score was the main metric used for model evaluation.

## ✅ Key Results
- The best-performing model achieved an **F1-score of 96%**, indicating excellent predictive performance.
- Important predictive features include purchase frequency, last transaction date, and total spending.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)

## 📂 Notebook Structure
- `Alpha_e_commerce.ipynb` – Main notebook containing the complete analytical and modeling process.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt` if available).
3. Open and run `Alpha_e_commerce.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

## 📈 Potential Improvements
- Integrate a product recommendation system for at-risk customers.
- Automate a real-time churn monitoring dashboard.
